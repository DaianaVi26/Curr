    <p> Supporting the Professionalism of ACM Members 
        The ACM Committee on Professional Ethics (COPE) is responsible for
        promoting ethical conduct among computing professionals by publicizing the
        Code of Ethics and by offering interpretations of the Code; planning and
        reviewing activities to educate membership in ethical decision making on
        issues of professional conduct; and reviewing and recommending updates to
        the Code of Ethics and its guidelines. <br>
        
        Guidance in Addressing Real-World Ethical Challenges 
        The Integrity Project, created by ACM's Committee on Professional Ethics, is
        a series of resources designed to aid ethical decision making. It includes
        case studies demonstrating how the principles can be applied to specific
        ethical challenges, and an Ask an Ethicist advice column to help computing
        professionals navigate the sometimes challenging choices that can arise in
        the course of their work.

        Ask an Ethicist 
        Ask an Ethicist invites ethics questions related to computing or technology.
        Have an interesting question, puzzle or conundrum? Submit yours via a
        form, and the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics (COPE) will answer a
        selection of them on the site. <br>
        
        Using the Code
        With the release of the updated Code of Ethics, ACM has created companion
        case studies that demonstrate how the principles of the Code can be applied
        to specific ethical challenges. Illustrative examples of hypothetical violations
        of or adherence to specific principles found in the Code—highlighting key
        nuances and directives—form the basis of the case studies.

        Code of Ethics Enforcement Procedures
        ACM expects all ACM and ACM Special Interest Group (SIG) members to
        make a commitment to engage in ethical professional conduct and abide by
        ACM’s Code of Ethics. This policy describes ACM’s procedure for enforcing
        the Code and may be used for complaints brought to ACM via ACM's other
        policies.
